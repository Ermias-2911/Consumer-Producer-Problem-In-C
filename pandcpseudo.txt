Command Line Arguments:
N: Max element in queue at a given time
P: No of producer thread
C: No of comsumer thread
X: No of elements enqueued by each producer thread
Ptime: Time for which producer thread sleeps
Ctime: Time for which consumer thread sleeps

Global Variables:
Queue 			#holds the data of queue and information like capacity, size, front and rear index
queue_operation		#Mutex to perform atomic queue
sync_variable 		#Mutex to perform synchronisation


1. Create bounded buffer queue
2. Print timestamp
3. Spawn C consumer thread 
	if thread index != 0
		Perform following steps ceiling(P*X/C)
	else
		Perform following steps (P*X - ceiling(P*X/C) * (C - 1))
	i) P(queue_operation)
	ii) If queue is empty retry
	iii) Dequeue(Queue)
	iv) Decrease size of Queue
	v) Adjust front index
		(queue->front + 1)%queue->capacity;
	vi) V(queue_operation)
	vii) Sleep (Ctime)_
4. Spawn P producer thread
	P(sync_variable)
	Perform folloing steps X times
        i) P(queue_operation)
	ii) If queue is full retry
        iii) Enqueue(Queue)
        iv) increase size of Queue
        v) Adjust rear index
		(queue->rear + 1)%queue->capacity;
        vi) V(queue_operation)
	vii) Sleep(Ptime)
	V(sync_variable)
5. Wait for threads to finish
6. Print timestamp
7. Print duration of program
